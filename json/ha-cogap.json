There weren't many stopping points so I crossed the river in Sheperdstown and had some lunch before continuing on to Williamsport where I stayed at the Hagerstown Red Roof Inn. In all I covered 108 miles. I was up and out reasonably early the next day and after stops in Hancock and Cumberland where the C&O trail ends and the GAP Trail begins on old rail beds. The final 16 miles was a 'railroad grade'' 1,500 feet up. Total 103 miles. Once in Frostburg the Gunter Hotel was not to be missed. I had pizza nearby and barred the door.",

			"pdesc": "I decided I needed to get into Pennsylvania so I started Day 3 continuing up hill across the Mason Dixon line and through the 'Big Savage' tunnel. Once thru I turned around and headed for the downhill section of my ride. 2,000 feet over 23 miles back to Cumberland. From there I returned to Williamsport and the Red Roof Inn. In all I cover 116 miles but it was the easiest day. The 4th day was harder than I thought because once I left the C&O Towpath I had to deal with the hills getting away from the Potomac River. This final 9 miles involved a number of walks which foreshadowed things to come out west.",
