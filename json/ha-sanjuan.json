The epic scenery begins before you even hit the trail.  After a couple hour drive through an overcast sky from Burlington we parked in a reasonably crowded parking lot. The switchbacks begin almost immediately. It was never steep so the 2.7 mile hike up to tree line was just long. Cloud cover didn't allow much in the way of views but what we could see was pretty cool.  The last mile plus traversed over to the pass and we got a bit of clearing once on top. All in all a good day in the North Cascade. We got a great appreciation for the mountains which were rugged and imposing.",
