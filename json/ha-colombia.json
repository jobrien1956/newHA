It also wasn't someplace I expected to go because of the 'troubles' over the years.  It turned out to be a nice combination of hikes in the mountains (Andes) and along the beaches (Caribbean Sea).  We flew thru Panama City and then on to the center of the country and finished with a tour of the walled city of Cartagena",
