Covered Bridges, majestic views, quaint small towns and pristine lakes were just of few of the highlights.   The terrain is a mix of rolling hills (not) and a few challenging climbs, making it appropriate for intermediate and advanced riders.  Kathy was a true hero to take on this ride.",

Later we reconvened for dinner at Friends Lake Inn's restaurant.",
