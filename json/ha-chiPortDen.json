About 2am a guy pulled over and offered a ride if I could drive which I  gladly accepted.  We drove down to just north of Sacramento where I5 and I80 intersect.  I've now been up for 24hrs.  I had a few miile walk to get to a place where the eastbound traffic from I5 south would pass me and eventually I got a ride to just outside Reno, NV.  From there I got a ride from a man in a pickup who explained that the buckshot in his 38 revolver would rip my face off if I tried anything.  Things got better from there.  The good news was he was going all the way across Nevada.  He left me in Elko, NV sometime in the afternoon.  Looking at the map and the remaining stretch of desert",
