I don't remember us having a bad day and we hit all our marks to stay in the hotels he had arranged.",

The following morning we were up early and took the S Kaibab Trail down to Phantom ranch.  In August it gets pretty hot so we were hustling by people all the way down.  We relaxed in Phatom Ranch for a short rest and then headed back out at exactly the worst time (12:30).  We got as much shade as we could and also had plenty of water.  At about half way we saw a thermometer which read 120F in the sun.  We were out by 4:30 and on our way to Winslow via the east exit of the Canyon which is also extremely beautiful. ",

In OKC we visted the Bombing Memorial and also toured the Museum before a nice dinner at Mickey Mantle's Reasturaunt next door to the minor league park in downtown.",

If life didn't get in the way traveling the interstates in the age of cell phones and 70 mph speed limits is very relaxing and a great way to better understand our wonderful country.",
