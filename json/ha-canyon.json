We went down the Tanner Trail and spent three nights along the river and then a long hike up the Hance Creek Trail to Horseshoe Mesa.  The final push in the early morning was up to Grandview Point.  By the end we had gotten a great GC education",

The next morning we woke up, scrambled around REI buying stuff we’d forgot, bummed some coffee from a hotel to make up for a night spent shivering instead of sleeping, and drove to the trailhead. We dropped in at a place called Lipan Point, about 9 miles south of where the Little Colorado meets the big.",

Upon return we found the crows were much smarter than anticipated and kevlar bags are not always the answer.  We continued down the river a few more miles and made camp along the river.",
