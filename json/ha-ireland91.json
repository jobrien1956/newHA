We decided to try and visit some additional locations in Ireland including where my father's grandfather, Timothy OBrien, was born and a second cousin of mine was still living.  We ended up driving out to the ring of Kerry after a brief visit with my father's 2nd cousin Lawerence O'Brien.  As best as we could tell he had no idea who we were but the pictures on the wall told me that these nice people had the same great, great grandfather as me",

We arrived pretty late in the day and knocked and an old woman answered the door after checking us out for a while.  They invited us in and immediately asked us if we'd like a 'sip.
