If you look closely at the pics below you can see that one of the shots went thru his antler.  Evenually he fell over and we made the trek over to him.  It took another 15 minutes to go down the gully and back up he other side to reach him.  We got a call on the walkie talkie from another guide who said 'What are you having a war over there?'",
